# Mortgage-Calculator-Frontend-Mentor-Challenge-
This mortgage calculator is an excellent project for practicing working with forms, client-side validation, and updating the DOM. Remember to focus on accessibility, too!

#About
This mortgage calculator is implemented using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing modern practices and features in these core technologies. No external libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue were used, keeping the project simple and approachable for a junior-level implementation. In the future, I may explore re-implementing it with such libraries or frameworks to enhance scalability, maintainability, and user experience.
