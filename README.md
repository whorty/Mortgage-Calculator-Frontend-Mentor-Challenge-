# About
This mortgage calculator is implemented using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing modern practices and features in these core technologies. I used this project to refresh my memory and practice my skills. No external libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue were used, keeping the project simple and approachable for a junior-level implementation. In the future, I may explore re-implementing it with such libraries or frameworks to enhance scalability, maintainability, and user experience.
